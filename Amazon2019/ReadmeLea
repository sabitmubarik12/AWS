Hey Lea,

1- Whitepaper section1 very essential. gets you from base to top.
2- Whitepaper section2 so relevant specially for AWS SOLUTIONS ARCHITECT ASSOCIATE EXAM.
3- Latest Reference Architecture for your personal dev.

***************
4- The-Orion-papers.pdf file is the one you need more than a fine tobbacco based cigarette :P.
It is the most interactive way to cover your theory
***************

5- AWSCertifiedSolutionsArchitect-Associate-min.pdf Do prepare these you will do much better.

You can pretty much focus on the 1, 2, 4, 5 points and maybe leave 3rd point.

You need to give about 6 to 7 hours daily for this.

A) It will take around 1 or 2 days taking 6 to 7 hours each day to cover point 1 and 2.
B) And spend rest of the days to cover point 4 and 5.
C) Give 1 to 2 hours max to me for covering off the practicals so that you can have all the image and workflow in your mind.

See the practicals.pdf file for the schedule of your practical labs.

Bestestestestestestestestest of luck. :)
